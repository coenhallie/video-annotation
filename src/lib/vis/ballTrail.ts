/**
 * The ball's trail: the path the tracked ball took over the last
 * TRAIL_HISTORY_S, ending at the ball, with a mark wherever it turned. Like
 * the team phase it is worked out here from the pipeline's own frames, not
 * reported by the pipeline.
 *
 * It is drawn from the ball's own positions, frame by frame, and nothing else.
 * An earlier trail drew each pass as a straight line from the player who
 * played it to the ball, and ended it when the next player was flagged with
 * the ball. The export flags possession on about one frame in ten, so most
 * passes never ended: when the ball turned, the line swung round its start to
 * follow it (15 of the 27 passes in two minutes of Manchester City vs PSG, by
 * up to 121 degrees). A point on this trail is where the ball was, so once
 * drawn it never moves; it only fades as it gets older.
 *
 * Where the ball turned is worked out from where it went either side of each
 * point: the direction it came from over the last TURN_ARM_METRES, and the
 * direction it left in over the next. Measured over a distance rather than a
 * number of frames, a ball standing still, which jitters by a few centimetres
 * a frame, has no direction to turn from. A turn of TURN_MIN_DEGREES or more
 * is marked once, at the point where the path bends most tightly: where the
 * points TURN_ARM_METRES before and after it, measured along the path the
 * ball travelled, are closest together. (Measured straight-line, every point
 * within TURN_ARM_METRES of where a ball was sent back the way it came turns
 * the same 180 degrees, so that alone cannot pick the point.) The mark only
 * appears once the ball has gone TURN_ARM_METRES past it, and since nothing
 * after that can change it, it then stays where it is.
 *
 * The path is broken where the ball was not tracked for longer than
 * MAX_GAP_S, rather than drawn straight across a stretch the export knows
 * nothing about: a cutaway can lose the ball for seconds. It is also broken
 * where the tracked ball jumps faster than MAX_BALL_SPEED, which no ball can:
 * the tracker has lost it and picked up something else. A jump for one frame
 * that comes straight back is left out, and the path carries on. The
 * Manchester City vs PSG export never jumps (31.5 m/s at most over two
 * minutes); the February export does, 159 times in four minutes, some by
 * hundreds of metres, each a line drawn across the pitch to nowhere.
 *
 * Only frames within TRAIL_LOOKBACK_S of the frame asked about are read, so
 * the answer is the same whether the replay played into the frame or seeked
 * to it.
