 * Goalkeepers and officials get colours that cannot be mistaken for either
 * team or for the green pitch: goalkeepers yellow, officials (the referee and
 * the linesmen) black. A goalkeeper's outline is their team's colour,
 * which keeps their team visible. Outfield outlines are a dark shade of the
 * team colour: red and the pitch green are close in brightness, so without an
 * edge red players blend into the pitch for anyone who cannot tell red from
 * green. White is kept for NEARBY_OUTLINE.
