 *
 * The design's goal overlaps the outer box's line, which hides that part of it.
 * As the goals are drawn over the line rather than inside the same group, they
 * are clipped to beyond the line, so the overlap cannot brighten it.
 *
 * Drawn in frame units through whatever transform the context already has, and
 * on every frame rather than into the pitch cache, so a struck net bowing out
 * costs a few lines rather than a rebuilt pitch.
