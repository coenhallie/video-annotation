 * from above: x to the right, y down the screen, and z away from the viewer,
 * so the half of the ball facing them is z < 0.
 *
 * A ball rolling along the ground turns about the horizontal axis square to
 * the way it is going, by the distance it went over its radius. The radius is
 * the one it is drawn at, so the pattern moves as a ball that size would.
 * Rolled at a real ball's rate it would turn several times a frame, and a
 * pattern that turns more than about half the gap between its patches in a
 * frame seems to turn backwards, or not at all: a step turns no more than
 * MAX_ROLL_STEP_RAD.
